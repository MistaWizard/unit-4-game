    <h1>Can you earn the perfect Pokedex Score?</h1>

    <div>
        <section>
            <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.</p>
            <p>There are four Pokemon below. By clicking on a Pokemon you will add a specific amount of Pokedex points to your total score.</p>
            <p>You win the game by matching your total Pokedex score to the random number. You lose the game if your total Pokedex score goes above the random number.</p>
            <p>The Pokedex value of each Pokemon is hidden from you until you click on it.</p>
            <p>Each time the game starts, the value of each Pokemon will change so don't expect to breeze through every time.</p>
